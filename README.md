# Exercise4_Git

You are engaged in a Blog Project development that necessitates the inclusion of two key functionalities: ‘List Post’ and ‘Post Detail’.
Task 1: Let’s use the git to handle the branching and release processes.
Task 2: A bug emerges in the ‘Post Detail’ feature following the release, Let’s use the git to handle the branching and hotfix processes.
Please note:
That this task does not concern the actual coding involved in the Blog Project but focuses on project management utilizing Git and the git. Presume that for each change made or “feature implemented,” you may add a placeholder text file or make some edits to existing files to emulate genuine software development tasks.
Don’t use Gitflow.
